    <p>I have completed a Full Stack Development Certificate, which has provided me with a comprehensive understanding
        of both front-end and back-end development. This program covered technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB. Through hands-on projects, I gained practical experience in
        building dynamic and scalable web applications, preparing me for a career in full stack development.</p>
